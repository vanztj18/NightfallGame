# NightfallGame
The game that was made for Intro to Software Design. This was a solo project.
Nightfall.java is the main class.
This was built using the Eclipse IDE. The game was made to run in Eclipse's console. 
This project was worked on over the course of a 14-semester. We where required to update and add to our project each week with content learned that week.

The game is played by being given a prompt, with multiple choices, each choice has a number, the player inputs the number of the choice they want to do and the game will move to the next prompt, the prompt it moves to depends on the choice of the player.


Final Grade on the Project: 96% (A)
